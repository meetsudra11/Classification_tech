Used the MNIST dataset, which is a set of 70,000 small images of digits handwritten by high school students and employees of the US Census Bureau. Each image is labeled with the digit it represents. This set has been studied so much that it is often called the “Hello World” of Machine Learning: whenever people come up with a new classification algorithm, they are curious to see how it will perform on MNIST.

This code performs cross-validation predictions using cross_val_predict, which generates predictions for each data point by training the SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) classifier on different subsets of the data. It then evaluates the performance of the model by computing the confusion matrix and F1 score. The confusion matrix provides a summary of prediction results, while the F1 score measures the model's accuracy by balancing precision and recall.
